# Small-games
A variety of small games I created since starting programming.

I chose to put games here that could be run standalone, without needing a platform. They are all either small enough to not have any purpose in a repo of their own, or are unfinished.


Here is a list:

A card game I started making to learn pygame. After I got the hang of using it I stopped producing the card game so this is unfinished.

An island game I made to learn more about the order components are developed. After attempting to add graphics I ran into some issues and decided to move on from the project, so this is also unfinished.

Traditional Snake game, with 2 player compatability, made for my website, during a hackathon. Is finished, and currently runs on the website as intended.

A game created for uni, the largest game in this repo, and is finished.

Noughts and Crosses, another game made for uni, is finished.

Pickle sandwich, a "simulation" I created when I was bored with having to write pseudocode. Is finished but short.

Turtle maze, one of my first proper games, made to test if the turtle library used primarily for teaching could be "actually useful". The game is finished so, I suppose it could be.
